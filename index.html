				<p class="col span_6">My name is Hillary Minor and I love to laugh about as much as I love to make lists. The type A part of my personality serves me well in my <a href="#creative"><b>professional life</b></a>, but I also pride myself on supportive personal relationships where I can fully express my goofy side. In high school, I was as likely to voluntarily reorganize the stagecraft prop room as I was to spend my lunchtime throwing pottery ... My creative side is mixed somewhat haphazardly with my organizational one. I’m still figuring out how best to encourage both, which is part of what motivated me to pursue this <a href="http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/it-foundations.html"><b>Certificate in IT Foundations</b></a> through UW.</p>

				<div class="col span_6">
					<p>I’ve been inhaling books since I could first distinguish sentences. Not much has changed over the years: I still spend a disproprotionate amount of my free time reading books - I love everything from funeral director memoirs to graphic novels to exposes on Victorian domestic life. Libraries and museums have always been safe havens (and heaven) for me. I am eternally grateful to my parents for encouraging an engagement with literature and art, because I believe that a deep appreciation of these areas is what makes us human.</p>
					<h3>Need a new book?</h3>
					<p>To motivate me to read more, I’ve been writing a book review blog since 2011: You can find it <a href="http://www.hillarywarden.com"><b>here</b></a>. It has also proven a great resource for family who are looking for new books to read, and a central place for me to track my newest literary discoveries. </p>
					<p> The name “Thothy Blog” refers to the Ancient Egyptian god of reading and knowledge: the ibis-headed Thoth. I finally had a chance to visit Egypt in 2009; to the left is a photo of me appreciating Thoth’s majesty.</p>

				<h2>Ebay and Thrifting</h2> 
			</div>
			<div class="row gutters">
				<img class="col span_6" src="images/Free.jpg" alt="Free of STUFF">
				<div class="col span_6">
					<p>Recently, I’ve started applying my lifelong obsession with thrift stores and garage sales to generate income by re-selling my finds on eBay.  Within a year of using eBay, I was awarded PowerSeller and Top Rated status, and I sell an average of 30 items a month.  I pride myself on excellent customer service, and have gotten great joy out of this endeavor (as well as turning a profit).  I absolutely love the “hunt” of thrifting and have aggressively committed myself to living minimally and well below my means.  You can see my seller profile <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/thrift_zilla/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_ipg=&_from="><b>here</b></a>.
					<p>Eventually, I’d like to add a page to my personal website that includes tips on saving money and selling on eBay. I have a few pages like this already (about <a href="http://www.hillarywarden.com/?p=17"><b>shopping at Goodwill</b></a>, and <a href="http://www.hillarywarden.com/?p=9"><b>going to garage sales</b></a>) but would like to expand on these topics.</p> 
					<p>Another new project has been wedding planning, which stretches my creativity re: not spending money.  It's an industry designed to suck you dry, so it's been quite an adventure breaking past the norm and planning around a severe self-imposed budget.  I'd like to expand on this topic at a future time <em>(i.e., once this crazy party is over!)</em>.</p>

						<p>I am a lifelong learner: I believe as firmly in the exercise of my mind as that of my body. And that’s saying a 
							lot, since a day for me isn’t complete without vinyasa yoga, spin or road cycling, a long walk, or lifting 
							weights. Outside of exercise, my favorite way to relax is by finishing the day with a new book -- I then review 
							all my favorite reads on my personal website; more <a href="#books"><b>here</b></a>. I indulged my deep-rooted 
							obsession with history in college, majoring in German history and minoring in Art History and Sociology. I won 
							first place for the UW History Department with my senior thesis on anti-semitism in propagandistic Nazi children’s 
							books and school curricula. I initially planned to continue working with local non-profits after I graduated, 
							given my five-year involvement with <a href="http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/seattle"><b>Ten Thousand Villages</b></a> 
							(a fair-trade store providing income for artists in developing countries) and a non-profit management 
							internship through <a href="https://outdoorsforall.org/"><b>Outdoors For All</b></a> (which is committed to 
							providing outdoor recreation to children and adults with disabilities).</p>

					<h3>Current Position</h3>
					<p>Instead, post-graduation in 2009, I took a deep dive into a whole new world: I’ve been working for the busiest Emergency Department and only Level 1 trauma center in the five-state region of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Idaho, and Montana. Patients from those areas are airlifted to Harborview Medical Center if they have the misfortune of needing critical clinical care. I am proud to contribute to Harborview’s mission in my work with the Emergency Room doctors, for whom I handle academic appointments, promotions, reviews, trainings, onboarding, compliance, and (most recently) elearning development. My job has evolved immensely from when I initially started, mostly due to my constant search for new projects and challenges. Most recently, I’ve volunteered to take on the management and development of our website, spearheaded a campaign to move all trainings onto a central Learning Management System, and have created and maintained a massive faculty database to internally track everything from gender to grant research. Using these IT systems, we have been able to standardize and increase efficiency in our administrative processes -- an outcome that I am exceptionally proud of. I hope to widen my perspective and possibilities with this <a href="http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/it-foundations.html"><b>UW Certificate in IT Foundations</b></a>, which I started in September 2014.</p>
