		<h2>Ebay and Thrifting</h2>
			<img src="images/Free.jpg" alt="Free of STUFF" width="400">
			<p>Recently, I’ve started applying my lifelong obsession with thrift stores and garage sales to generate income by re-selling my finds on eBay.  Within a year of using eBay, I was awarded PowerSeller and Top Rated status, and I sell an average of 30 items a month.  I pride myself on excellent customer service, and have gotten great joy out of this endeavor (as well as turning a profit).  I absolutely love the “hunt” of thrifting and have aggressively committed myself to living minimally and well below my means.  You can see my seller profile <a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/hillarywarden"><b>here</b></a>.
			<p>Eventually, I’d like to add a page to my personal website that includes tips on saving money and selling on eBay. I have a few pages like this already (about <a href="http://www.hillarywarden.com/?p=17"><b>shopping at Goodwill</b></a>, and <a href="http://www.hillarywarden.com/?p=9"><b>going to garage sales</b></a>) but would like to expand on these topics.</p> 
			<p>Another new project has been wedding planning, which stretches my creativity re: not spending money.  It's an industry designed to suck you dry, so it's been quite an adventure breaking past the norm and planning around a severe self-imposed budget.  I'd like to expand on this topic at a future time <em>(i.e., once this crazy party is over!)</em>.</p>
