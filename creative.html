			<p>I am a lifelong learner: I believe as firmly in the exercise of my mind as that of my body. And that’s saying a lot, since a day for me isn’t complete without vinyasa yoga, spin or road cycling, a long walk, or lifting weights. Outside of exercise, my favorite way to relax is by finishing the day with a new book -- I then review all my favorite reads on my personal website; more <a href="reviews.html"><b>here</b></a>. I indulged my deep-rooted obsession with history in college, majoring in German history and minoring in Art History and Sociology. I won first place for the UW History Department with my senior thesis on anti-semitism in propagandistic Nazi children’s books and school curricula. I initially planned to continue working with local non-profits after I graduated, given my five-year involvement with <a href="http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/seattle"><b>Ten Thousand Villages</b></a> (a fair-trade store providing income for artists in developing countries) and a non-profit management internship through <a href="https://outdoorsforall.org/"><b>Outdoors For All</b></a> (which is committed to providing outdoor recreation to children and adults with disabilities).</p>

		<h2>Current Position</h2>
		<p>Instead, post-graduation in 2009, I took a deep dive into a whole new world: I’ve been working for the busiest Emergency Department and only Level 1 trauma center in the five-state region of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Idaho, and Montana. Patients from those areas are airlifted to Harborview Medical Center if they have the misfortune of needing critical clinical care. I am proud to contribute to Harborview’s mission in my work with the Emergency Room doctors, for whom I handle academic appointments, promotions, reviews, trainings, onboarding, compliance, and (most recently) elearning development. My job has evolved immensely from when I initially started, mostly due to my constant search for new projects and challenges. Most recently, I’ve volunteered to take on the management and development of our website, spearheaded a campaign to move all trainings onto a central Learning Management System, and have created and maintained a massive faculty database to internally track everything from gender to grant research. Using these IT systems, we have been able to standardize and increase efficiency in our administrative processes -- an outcome that I am exceptionally proud of. I hope to widen my perspective and possibilities with this <a href="http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/it-foundations.html"><b>UW Certificate in IT Foundations</b></a>, which I started in September 2014.</p>
